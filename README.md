## What is it?

1. It is a group word game for children to teach them about division.
2. It is used as an interview screening device for computer programmers.

## The rules

1. Players generally sit in a circle.
2. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and the players then count upwards in turn.
3. Any number divisible by *3* is replaced by the word *fizz* and any number divisible by *5* by the word *buzz*. Numbers divisible by *15* become *fizz buzz*.
4. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.
