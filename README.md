# Fizz buzz

## Goals

It is my *Hello World* repository and its sole purpose is to help me to get familiar with GitHub. The project is based on the [*Fizz buzz*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) game.

## Game

1. It is used as a coding interview tool for computer programmers.
2. It is a group word game for children to teach them about division.

## Rules

1. Players generally sit in a circle.
2. The player designated to go first says the number *1*, and the players then count upwards in turn.
3. Any number divisible by *3* is replaced by the word *fizz* and any number divisible by *5* by the word *buzz*. Numbers divisible by *15* become *fizz buzz*.
4. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.
